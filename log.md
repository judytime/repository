# 100 Days Of Code - Log


**Today's Progress**: Started Coding Challenge on FreeCodeCamp:  Worked on basic HTML and CSS.  Learned to add text paragraphs, headers, and image. Learned to use classes in CSS to change text color, and add borders to an image.

**Thoughts:** I haven't worked with HTML and CSS since middle school so it was a great review session.  Worked on it for 1 hour.
