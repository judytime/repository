# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: February 21, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Started Coding Challenge on FreeCodeCamp:  Worked on basic HTML and CSS.  Learned to add text paragraphs, headers, and image. Learned to use classes in CSS to change text color, and add borders to an image.

**Thoughts:** I haven't worked with HTML and CSS since middle school so it was a great review session.  Worked on it for 1 hour.

### Day 2: February 22, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Worked on items/challenges in freecodecamp and completed the following: making lists, buttons, and checklists and setting default choices to buttons and checklists. I learned how to create divisions within the HTML and adding attributes to the divisions via CSS.

**Thoughts:** Was not super pumped for today's challenges.  Need to start setting goals on objectives for learning these languages.
